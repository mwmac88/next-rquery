This project was created to explore the [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com) library within the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. 

The aim of this project was to gain an understanding of how react-query can be employed to assist with the seperation of concerns between local client state and server state. A further aim was to understand the performance benefits gained by utilising this library.

The application consists of fictional Quidditch teams partaking in fictional events with the ability to place bets on each outcome which are subsequently added to a betslip.
